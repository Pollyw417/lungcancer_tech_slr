We investigated the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and potential efficacy of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and walking promotion to disrupt a postulated “dyspnea-inactivity” spiral. Methods Between January and December 2022, we recruited lung cancer survivors from Kaiser Permanente Colorado who completed curative-intent therapy within 1–6 months into a phase-IIb, parallel-group, pilot randomized trial (1:1 allocation). The 12-week intervention, delivered via telemedicine, consisted of exercise training (IMT + walking), education, and behavior change support. Control participants received educational materials on general exercise. We determined feasibility a priori: enrollment of ≥ 20% eligible patients, ≥ 75% retention, study measure completion, and adherence. We assessed acceptability using the Telemedicine-Satisfaction-and-Usefulness-Questionnaire and safety events that included emergency department visits or hospitalizations. Patient-centered outcome measures (PCOMs) included dyspnea (University-of-California-San-Diego-Shortness-of-Breath-Questionnaire), physical activity (activPAL™ steps/day), functional exercise capacity (mobile-based-six-minute-walk-test), and health-related quality of life (HRQL, St.-George’s-Respiratory-Questionnaire). We used linear mixed-effects models to assess potential efficacy. Results We screened 751 patients, identified 124 eligible, and consented 31 (25%) participants. Among 28 participants randomized (14/group), 22 (11/group) completed the study (79% retention). Intervention participants returned > 90% of self-reported activity logs, completed > 90% of PCOMs, and attended > 90% of tele-visits; 75% of participants performed IMT at the recommended dose. Participants had high satisfaction with tele-visits and found the intervention useful. There was no statistically significant difference in safety events between groups. Compared to control participants from baseline to follow-up, intervention participants had statistically significant and clinically meaningful improved HRQL (SGRQ total, symptom, and impact scores) (standardized effect size: -1.03 to -1.30). Conclusions Among lung cancer survivors following curative-intent therapy, telemedicine-based IMT + walking was feasible, acceptable, safe, and had potential to disrupt the “dyspnea-inactivity” spiral. Future efficacy/effectiveness trials are warranted and should incorporate IMT and walking promotion to improve HRQL., Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05059132.

The app was used in a 2-week study to register two lung cancer patients’ activity without problems or interruptions. The patients frequently reported activities, symptoms, and questionnaires, indicating their engagement with the app. They registered their experience through the UEQ-S integrated into the app. Patient 1 mainly reported a neutral experience, while Patient 2 found it highly positive. They considered the app leading-edge and helpful and would recommend it to others, while both patients valued it positively (3.72 and 4.64 on a scale of 1–5). The app’s aesthetics and its notifications helped their engagement. We found correlations between sensors’ data and patients’ QoL. We also detected QoL and functional status variations after treatment for both patients.

No studies have assessed pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) employing a mobile app and an Internet of Things device in advanced lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Objective: This study aimed to determine the feasibility and efficacy of smartphone app–based PR on exercise capacity, symptom management, and QoL in patients with advanced lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: A total of 100 patients were recruited in a prospective, single-arm intervention study using a smartphone app–based PR program for 12 weeks. Exercise capacity (6-min walking distance, 6MWD), QoL, symptom scale scores, and distress indexes were investigated. Results: A total of 90 patients completed the PR program. The most common cause of drop out was hospitalization because of cancer progression. After PR, there was significant improvement in the 6MWD; 380.1 m (SD 74.1) at baseline, 429.1 m (SD 58.6) at 6 weeks (P<.001), and 448.1 m (SD 50.0) at 12 weeks (P<.001). However, the dyspnea scale score showed no significant improvement in the patients overall, but there was a trend for improvement in those with a stable tumor response (P=.07). Role (P=.02), emotional (P<.001), and social functioning (P=.002) scale scores showed significant improvement after PR. Symptom scale scores for fatigue (P<.001), anorexia (P=.047), and diarrhea (P=.01) also showed significant improvement. There was significant improvement in depression (P=.048) and anxiety (P=.01), whereas there was no significant change in QoL (P=.06) and severity of pain (P=.24). Conclusions: Smartphone app–based PR represents an effective and feasible program to improve exercise capacity and to manage symptoms and distress in patients with advanced lung cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy.",2/4/2019,10/7/2024 15:27,10/7/2024 15:27,10/7/2024 15:27,e11094,,2,7,,,Mobile Phone App–Based Pulmonary Rehabilitation for Chemotherapy-Treated Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer,,,,,,,EN,"Unless stated otherwise, all articles are open-access distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work (""first published in JMIR mHealth and uHealth..."") is properly cited with original URL and bibliographic citation information.

Good quality of survivorship care post-surgery is essential to optimize recovery and prevent unscheduled healthcare use. The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can improve post-surgery care, as it enables frequent monitoring of health status in daily life, provides timely and personalized feedback to patients and professionals, and improves accessibility to rehabilitation programs. Despite its promises, implementation of telehealthcare applications is challenging, often hampered by non-acceptance of the developed service by its end-users. A promising approach is to involve the end-users early and continuously during the developmental process through a so-called user-centred design approach.

A Qualitative Study,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,,10.2196/jmir.2842,https://www.jmir.org/2014/2/e37,"Background: Since its launch in 2003, the Dutch Lung Cancer Information Center&#8217;s (DLIC) website has become increasingly popular. The most popular page of the website is the section &#8220;Ask the Physician&#8221;, where visitors can ask an online lung specialist questions anonymously and receive an answer quickly. Most questions were not only asked by lung cancer patients but also by their informal caregivers. Most questions concerned specific information about lung cancer. Objective: Our goal was to explore the reasons why lung cancer patients and caregivers search the Internet for information and ask online lung specialists questions on the DLIC&#8217;s interactive page, &#8220;Ask the Physician&#8221;, rather than consulting with their own specialist. Methods: This research consisted of a qualitative study with semistructured telephone interviews about medical information-seeking behavior (eg, information needs, reasons for querying online specialists). The sample comprised 5 lung cancer patients and 20 caregivers who posed a question on the interactive page of the DLIC website. Results: Respondents used the Internet and the DLIC website to look for lung cancer&#8211;related information (general/specific to their personal situation) and to cope with cancer. They tried to achieve a better understanding of the information given by their own specialist and wanted to be prepared for the treatment trajectory and disease course. This mode of information supply helped them cope and gave them emotional support. The interactive webpage was also used as a second opinion. The absence of face-to-face contact made respondents feel freer to ask for any kind of information. By being able to pose a question instantly and receiving a relatively quick reply from the online specialist to urgent questions, respondents felt an easing of their anxiety as they did not have to wait until the next consultation with their own specialist. Conclusions: The DLIC website with its interactive page is a valuable complementary mode of information supply and supportive care for lung cancer patients and caregivers.",2/4/2014,10/7/2024 15:34,10/7/2024 15:34,10/7/2024 15:34,e2842,,2,16,,,Why Do Patients and Caregivers Seek Answers From the Internet and Online Lung Specialists?,,,,,,,EN,,,,,www.jmir.org,,"Company: Journal of Medical Internet Research Distributor: Journal of Medical Internet Research Institution: Journal of Medical Internet Research Label: Journal of Medical Internet Research Publisher: JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada",,C:\Users\polly\Zotero\storage\IYTYVVDB\Schook et al. - 2014 - Why Do Patients and Caregivers Seek Answers From the Internet and Online Lung Specialists A Qualita.pdf; C:\Users\polly\Zotero\storage\C6P6SEP6\e37.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This hospital implemented a digital platform for the collection of patient-reported outcomes and the standardisation of care pathways. Also, a follow-up by the multidisciplinary care team was put in place. Methods Evaluation was done by employing a mixed method approach with data analysis of all included patients (n = 201), a pilot study (n = 30) and semi-structured interviews with the care team (n = 5). Results Overall, 95% of all lung cancer patients of two thoracic oncologists agreed to participate in the digital follow-up during the period January 2018 to September 2020 (201 participating patients). The response rates of those patients were high: 92% of the weekly questionnaires and 90% of the 6-weekly ICHOM questionnaires were responded. Based on the pilot study, we conclude that questions are clear and the platform is user-friendly for 90% of patients in the pilot. The interviews revealed that the weekly follow-up has a positive impact on the patient–provider communication and makes it easier to discuss psychological and palliative care needs.

Design  Crossover design in which participants served as their own control. Setting  Outpatient clinic at a comprehensive cancer center in the southeastern United States. Sample  123 adults receiving initial chemotherapy treatments. Methods  Participants were randomly assigned to receive the VR distraction intervention during one chemotherapy treatment and then received no intervention (control) during an alternate matched chemotherapy treatment. The Adapted Symptom Distress Scale–2, Revised Piper Fatigue Scale, and State Anxiety Inventory were used to measure symptom distress. The Presence Questionnaire and an open-ended questionnaire were used to evaluate the subjects’ VR experience. The influence of type of cancer, age, and gender on symptom outcomes was explored. Mixed models were used to test for differences in levels of symptom distress. Main Research Variables  Virtual reality and symptom distress. Findings  Patients had an altered perception of time (p < 0.001) when using VR, which validates the distracting capacity of the intervention. Evaluation of the intervention indicated that patients believed the head-mounted device was easy to use, they experienced no cybersickness, and 82% would use VR again. However, analysis demonstrated no significant differences in symptom distress immediately or two days following chemotherapy treatments. Conclusions  Patients stated that using VR made the treatment seem shorter and that chemotherapy treatments with VR were better than treatments without the distraction intervention. However, positive experiences did not result in a decrease in symptom distress. The findings support the idea that using VR can help to make chemotherapy treatments more tolerable, but clinicians should not assume that use of VR will improve chemotherapy-related symptoms. Implications for Nursing  Patients found using VR during chemotherapy treatments to be enjoyable.

METHODS: In total, 285 informal caregiver-patient dyads were assigned randomly to receive, for up to 25 months, standard care plus training on and access to either use of the Internet and a list of Internet sites about lung cancer (the Internet arm) or CHESS (the CHESS arm). Caregivers agreed to use CHESS or the Internet and to complete bimonthly surveys; for patients, these tasks were optional. The primary endpoint—patient symptom distress—was measured by caregiver reports using a modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. RESULTS: Caregivers in the CHESS arm consistently reported lower patient physical symptom distress than caregivers in the Internet arm. Significant differences were observed at 4 months (P = .031; Cohen d = .42) and at 6 months (P = .004; d = .61). Similar but marginally significant effects were observed at 2 months (P = .051; d = .39) and at 8 months (P = .061; d = .43). Exploratory analyses indicated that survival curves did not differ significantly between the arms (log-rank P = .172), although a survival difference in an exploratory subgroup analysis suggested an avenue for further study.

Objective               To evaluate whether delivering early palliative care via secure video vs in-person visits has an equivalent effect on quality of life in patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).                                         Design, Setting, and Participants               Randomized, multisite, comparative effectiveness trial from June 14, 2018, to May 4, 2023, at 22 US cancer centers among 1250 patients within 12 weeks of diagnosis of advanced NSCLC and 548 caregivers.                                         Intervention               Participants were randomized to meet with a specialty-trained palliative care clinician every 4 weeks either via video visit or in person in the outpatient clinic from the time of enrollment and throughout the course of disease. The video visit group had an initial in-person visit to establish rapport, followed by subsequent virtual visits.                                         Main Outcomes and Measures               Equivalence of the effect of video visit vs in-person early palliative care on quality of life at week 24 per the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung questionnaire (equivalence margin of ±4 points; score range: 0-136, with higher scores indicating better quality of life). Participants completed study questionnaires at enrollment and at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48.                                         Results                                By 24 weeks, participants (mean age, 65.5 years; 54.0% women; 82.7% White) had a mean of 4.7 (video) and 4.9 (in-person) early palliative care encounters. Patient-reported quality-of-life scores were equivalent between groups (video mean, 99.7 vs in-person mean, 97.7; difference, 2.0 [90% CI, 0.1-3.9];                 P                  = .04 for equivalence). Rate of caregiver participation in visits was lower for video vs in-person early palliative care (36.6% vs 49.7%;                 P                  &amp;lt; .001).

Background Routine symptom assessment for lung cancer patients in a fast-paced clinical environment is demanding. Mobile health technology offers a potential platform for symptom assessment and paves the way for tailored self-care intervention. Design A feasibility study using a mixed method design. Method A convenience sample of 10 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients used tablet personal computers to self-report common symptoms: dyspnoea, fatigue, pain, and anxiety. A nurse reviewed the assessment results and provided tailored educational interventions. Acceptability was evaluated by the Electronic Self-Report Assessment-Cancer. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore the patients' perceptions of this symptom assessment method. Data were collected from January to March 2016. Results An Electronic Self-Report Assessment-Cancer mean score of 23.5 (SD 2.7) showed moderate acceptance of the assessment method.

Methods:            The survival in 98 consecutive patients with lung cancer was assessed. The first part of them (the control arm) was retrospectively recruited between March 2011 and August 2012. The second half of them (the experimental arm) was prospectively recruited between August 2012 and December 2013 to weekly fill a form of 11 self-assessed symptoms, then processed by the “sentinel” Web-application. Data were sent to this sentinel application in real-time between planned visits. An email alert was sent to the oncologist when self-scored symptoms matched some predefined criteria. Follow-up visit and imaging were then organized after a phone call for confirming the suspect symptoms. In the control arm (49 patients), a common follow-up was applied (visit and imaging every 2 to 6 mo according to stage of tumor and kind of treatment).           Results:            Median follow-up duration was 12.3 months in the experimental arm and 16.7 months in the control arm (P=0.27). Survival was significantly better in the sentinel arm than in the control arm (P=0.0014). Median survival was 16.7 months in the control arm and 22.4 months in the experimental arm. One-year survival was 86.6% in the experimental arm and 59.1% in the control arm.

Objective:               We created, and pilot tested a Virtual Integrative Oncology Shared Medical Appointment Series (VIOSMAS) to assess its feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy at an urban academic teaching hospital.                                         Methods:               The 7-session hour-long Living Well with and after Cancer series included didactics, multi-disciplinary experiential sessions, and group discussion. Topics included (1) Introduction, (2) Herbs/Botanicals/Fungi, (3) Mindful Movement, (4) Acupuncture, (5) Narratives and Nature, (6) Diet and Culinary Medicine, and (7) Vitamins/Supplements.

Patients were from diverse demographics. Pre-program, patients reported desiring assistance in addressing diverse symptoms including fatigue, insomnia, pain, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Post-series, patients reported that the VIOSMAS addressed their goals and symptoms; they also reported incorporating recommended lifestyle changes in diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management; they were satisfied with the number of sessions and telehealth format. The participating clinicians reported high levels of satisfaction with VIOSMAS.

It remains an open question whether the overall survival (OS) in these patients could be improved by using a web-mediated follow-up rather than classical scheduled follow-up and imaging.Advanced-stage lung cancer patients without evidence of disease progression after or during initial treatment were randomly assigned in a multicenter phase III trial to compare a web-mediated follow-up algorithm (experimental arm), based on weekly self-scored patient symptoms, with routine follow-up with CT scans scheduled every three to six months according to the disease stage (control arm). In the experimental arm, an alert email was automatically sent to the oncologist when self-scored symptoms matched predefined criteria. The primary outcome was OS.From June 2014 to January 2016, 133 patients were enrolled and 121 were retained in the intent-to-treat analysis; 12 deemed ineligible after random assignment were not subsequently followed. Most of the patients (95.1%) had stage III or IV disease. The median follow-up was nine months.

Family caregivers have the potential to help patients manage those symptoms, as well as their own stress, if they are equipped with the proper resources. Electronic health (eHealth) systems may be able to provide those resources. Very sick patients may not be able to use such systems themselves to report their symptoms but family caregivers could. Objective: The aim of this paper was to assess the effects on cancer patient symptom distress of an eHealth system that alerts clinicians to significant changes in the patient’s symptoms, as reported by a family caregiver. Methods: A pooled analysis from two randomized clinical trials (NCT00214162 and NCT00365963) compared outcomes at 12 months for two unblinded groups: a control group (Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System [CHESS]-Only) that gave caregivers access to CHESS, an online support system, and an experimental group (CHESS+CR [Clinician Report]), which also had CHESS but with a CR that automatically alerted clinicians if symptoms exceeded a predetermined threshold of severity. Participants were dyads (n=235) of patients with advanced lung, breast, or prostate cancer and their respective family caregivers from 5 oncology clinics in the United States of America. The proportion of improved patient threshold symptoms was compared between groups using area-under-the-curve analysis and binomial proportion tests. The proportion of threshold symptoms out of all reported symptoms was also examined. Results: When severe caregiver-reported symptoms were shared with clinicians, the symptoms were more likely to be subsequently reported as improved than when the symptoms were not shared with clinicians (P<.001). Fewer symptom reports were completed in the group of caregivers whose reports went to clinicians than in the CHESS-Only group (P<.001), perhaps because caregivers, knowing their reports might be sent to a doctor, feared they might be bothering the clinician. Conclusions: This study suggests that an eHealth system designed for caregivers that alerts clinicians to worrisome changes in patient health status may lead to reduced patient distress.

In a randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of an automated symptom management system was tested to determine if it reduced chemotherapy-related symptoms. Prospectively, 358 patients beginning chemotherapy were randomized to the Symptom Care at Home (SCH) intervention (n = 180) or enhanced usual care (UC) (n = 178). Participants called the automated monitoring system daily reporting severity of 11 symptoms. SCH participants received automated self-management coaching and nurse practitioner (NP) telephone follow-up for poorly controlled symptoms. NPs used a guideline-based decision support system. Primary endpoints were symptom severity across all symptoms, and the number of severe, moderate, mild, and no symptom days. A secondary endpoint was individual symptom severity. Mixed effects linear modeling and negative binominal regressions were used to compare SCH with UC. SCH participants had significantly less symptom severity across all symptoms (P < 0.001). On average, the relative symptom burden reduction for SCH participants was 3.59 severity points (P < 0.001), roughly 43% of UC. With a very rapid treatment benefit, SCH participants had significant reductions in severe (67% less) and moderate (39% less) symptom days compared with UC (both P < 0.001). All individual symptoms, except diarrhea, were significantly lower for SCH participants (P < 0.05). Symptom Care at Home dramatically improved symptom outcomes.

Objective: We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and usability of the patient portal and generate preliminary evidence on its impact. Methods: Lung cancer patients currently or recently treated with curative intent could use MyAVL noncommittally for 4 months. Feasibility, usability, and preliminary impact (ie, patient activation, quality of life, and physical activity) were studied by means of questionnaires, a focus group, and analysis of user log data. Results: We included 37 of 123 eligible patients (mean age 59.6 years). The majority of responses (82%) were positive about using MyAVL, 69% saw it as a valuable addition to care, and 56% perceived increased control over their health.

However, little data exist on the impact of telemedicine on quality and accessibility of oncologic care. This study assessed whether conducting an office visit for thoracic oncology patients via telemedicine affected time to treatment initiation and accessibility. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with thoracic malignancies seen by a multidisciplinary team during the first surge of COVID-19 cases in Philadelphia (March 1 to June 30, 2020). Patients with an index visit for a new phase of care, defined as a new diagnosis, local recurrence, or newly discovered metastatic disease, were included. Results 240 distinct patients with thoracic malignancies were seen: 132 patients (55.0%) were seen initially in-person vs 108 (45.0%) via telemedicine. The majority of visits were for a diagnosis of a new thoracic cancer (87.5%). Among newly diagnosed patients referred to the thoracic oncology team, the median time from referral to initial visit was significantly shorter amongst the patients seen via telemedicine vs. in-person (median 5.0 vs. 6.5 days, p < 0.001). Patients received surgery (32.5%), radiation (24.2%), or systemic therapy (30.4%). Time from initial visit to treatment initiation by modality did not differ by telemedicine vs in-person: surgery (22 vs 16 days, p = 0.47), radiation (27.5 vs 27.5 days, p = 0.86, systemic therapy (15 vs 13 days, p = 0.45).

We examined the impact of the dialogues on age-related differences in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among newly diagnosed cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. We assessed HRQOL among 34 patients, including 15 older adults (65 years or older) and 19 younger adults who were followed for 6 months. Older patients consistently reported better HRQOL scores over the treatment period. In multivariate analysis, older patients reported 10.35 points higher in HRQOL (P = .007). In addition, patients who reported no nervousness while undergoing chemotherapy had an 8.60-point increase in HRQOL scores (P = .012). The dialogues model can make important improvement in symptom management and HRQOL, especially in older adults receiving chemotherapy. Older and younger adults with cancer may benefit equally in cancer treatment in a setting with appropriately managed symptoms.

Objectives This study tested the efficacy of an automated mHealth platform that included caregiver coaching on patient symptom care and nurse notifications of poorly controlled symptoms. The primary outcome was caregiver perception of patients’ overall symptom severity throughout hospice care and at weeks one, two, four, and eight. Secondary outcomes compared individual symptom severity. Methods Caregivers (n = 298) were randomly assigned to the Symptom Care at Home (SCH) intervention (n = 144) or usual hospice care (UC) (n = 154). All caregivers placed daily calls to the automated system that assessed the presence and severity of 11 end-of-life patient physical and psychosocial symptoms. SCH caregivers received automated coaching on symptom care based on reported patient symptoms and their severity. Moderate-to-severe symptoms were also relayed to the hospice nurse. Results The SCH intervention produced a mean overall symptom reduction benefit, over UC, of 4.89 severity points (95% CI 2.86–6.92) (P < 0.001), with a moderate effect size (d = 0.55).

The use of wearable technology has already proved its potentials in improving healthcare research, clinical work, and patient care. The real time data allows the care providers to monitor the patients' symptoms remotely, prioritize the patients' visits, assist in decision-making, and carry out advanced care planning. Objectives: The primary objective of our study was to investigate the potential use of wearable devices as a prognosis tool among patients in hospice care and palliative care, and the secondary objective was to examine the association between wearable devices and clinical data in the context of patient outcomes, such as discharge and deceased at various time intervals. Methods: We employed a prospective observational research approach to continuously monitor the hand movements of the selected 68 patients between December 2019 and June 2022 via an actigraphy device at hospice or palliative care ward of Taipei Medical University Hospital (TMUH) in Taiwan. Results: The results revealed that the patients with higher scores in the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) tended to live at discharge, while Palliative Prognostic Score (PaP) and Palliative prognostic Index (PPI) also shared the similar trend. In addition, the results also confirmed that all these evaluating tools only suggested rough rather than accurate and definite prediction. The outcomes (May be Discharge (MBD) or expired) were positively correlated with accumulated angle and spin values, i.e., the patients who survived had higher angle and spin values as compared to those who died/expired. Conclusion: The outcomes had higher correlation with angle value compared to spin and ACT. The correlation value increased within the first 48 h and then began to decline.

Physical activity has been proven effective in reducing fatigue, but unmet needs remain regarding the provision and access to adapted programmes, which efficiently addresses the main barriers to PA. METHODS: The PACTIMe-FEAS study primarily aimed at primarily to evaluate the feasibility and the acceptability of a videoconference-based 6-month programme promoting physical activity, and secondarily to assess its potential post-immediate and short-term effectiveness in reducing fatigue in cancer patients under immune therapy. Numeric self-reported questionnaires (Visual Analogue Scale-fatigue, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Échelle de Motivation envers l'Activité Physique en contexte de Santé, Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Insomnia Severity Index) were completed by participants through an online secure platform at three time points: just before (T1), and after (T2) the programme, and 3 months later (T3). RESULTS: Sixteen participants (50% male, 50% female, mean age 54 years, 69% melanoma, 31% overweight), with moderate-to-severe fatigue, entered the internet-delivered intervention; 14 completed it, with an average completion rate of physical activity supervised sessions of 75%. Satisfaction was high, confirming a demand for group format, personalised approach, professional guidance and home-based device, to support the practice of regular physical activity. A decrease in fatigue was observed at the end of the programme. DISCUSSION: The recruitment process did prove to be challenging, with a relatively small eligible population, and will need to be reconsidered to envision a larger scale trial.
